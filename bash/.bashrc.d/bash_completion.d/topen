# Bash completion script to move and load .torrent files

#    -F function
#	The shell function function is executed in the current shell
#	environment.  When the function is executed, the first  argument
#	($1)  is  the name  of  the command whose arguments are being
#	completed, the second argument ($2) is the word being completed,
#	and the third argument ($3) is the word preceding the word being
#	completed on the current command line.  When it finishes, the
#	possible completions are  retrieved  from the value of the
#	COMPREPLY array variable.
